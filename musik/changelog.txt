a2:
 
  - bug where hiding selection boxes and reshowing would 
    scramble sizes
  - if musik is playing and a song is double clicked, the 
    playlist is no longer exchanged for the visible one. the
    new song is inserted as the next song in line and started.
  - fixed a bug where maximizing, minimizing, then restoring
    would not restore to maximized.
  - crossfader presets and settings are now available to
    the user. see file -> preferences -> sound -> crossfader
  - duplicate equalizer and crossfader preset names are
    no longer allowed. this keeps stuff a lot easier
    to maintain in the backend.
  - lots of internal cleaning for musikCore's CmusikLibrary
  - redid the equalizer presets dialog. 
  - fixed tab ordering in all dialogs
  - added "Shuffle Now Playing" to playlist context menu
  - "Shuffle Now Playing" menu option disabled if now playing
    playlist is empty.
  - changed "Standard Playlists" to "Playlists" in the
    sources panel
  - fixes a bug where parenting a box, selecting nothing,
    then selecting an item from another box would 
    not reparent
  - playlists are now stored as filenames, not ids.
  - memory leak when prompting to save playlist.
  - fixed sources drag and drop from standard playlists
  - disallow any undesirable drag and drop activity
  - playlist drag and dropping crash when not playing
  - from selection boxes -> playlist drag and drop bug fix
  - CTRL + A / CTRL + D in playlist to select and deslect 
    all the items
  - much better theme support
  - changed rollover button behavior for playback
    buttons
  - fixed the problem with the rating selection boxes
  - dustin's bug with shuffling then drag and dropping

don't expect another build for a few weeks. please
stress test this build if at all possible. see if you
can confuse it into crashing. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

stuff that isn't implemented / doesn't work yet: 

  - playlist information area 
  - dynamic playlist creation
  - dialog to view tag properties

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

known bugs:
 
  - crashes on showing window: it has been impossible thus far 
    to reproduce on command, and simon and i have each
    seen it only once.

   what we've been up to since 0.2.1 CVS: a quick ramble

      musik, up to version 0.2.1, was not ment or developed
      to be an extremely usable, stable product. it was a 
      concept to test various aspects of creating an
      extremely easy and powerful audio library and player.  
          
      we came to one conclusion after almost a year of
      development and two, maybe three of planning:
      the backend and the frontend must exist separate. 
      
      the backend would be completely independant 
      of any gui. why?

          - no cross platform gui toolkit offered 
            quite the flexability we wanted. 

          - becuase the core contains no gui, it could be 
            nearly complete ANSI C++, as long as we chose
            the right libraries to use for helpers (threads,
            sql access, etc).

          - to limit overhead

          - not only could we easily use the core to make 
            our own mp3 player, but so could others

       platforms we support:

          - supported: 
           
            windows nt 4.0, 
            windows 2000
            windows xp
            linux with oss and alsa 

          - unsupported: 

             windows 95
             windows 98
             windows me. 

             from our personal experience dustin and i believe 
             the preceding versions of windows to be inherently 
             unstable.

             musik will probably run on these platforms, but is
             not officially supported, meaning we may help you,
             we may not. sorry. :(
              
       whats new with the windows gui?

           - completely redesigned interface. moved from wxWindows to
             mfc, using limited overhead while still sporting a lot 
             of features. oh yeah -- and its fast. really fast.

           - minimal cpu and memory usage making it very lightweight.

           - dockable panels (everyone should be excited)

           - automatic saving and loading of equalizer presets
             on a per song basis or through the preset manager.

           - crossfader is more accurate than ever before, and
             now has its own preset manager (dialog not
             implemented yet).

           - gui workflow has been extremely optimized with the new 
             "Now Playing" sources entry.

       and whats new with the linux gui?

           - havn't even started it yet.
