TODO:

- Dynamic playlist editor and builder.  
- File extension/mime type association dialog in preferences.
- Command line starting, stopping playback of files.
- File drop support, accept files dropped from Explorer, add them to the library.
- Smaller view with just the player
- Controls to toggle activities and sources, built into the main frame. Not sure what they would look like.
- Drop down boxes on the activity titles to change the type without going into preferences.
- Preference to change the every-other-line highlight color
- Trayicon icon exists now,but maybe add a preference to minimize to taskbar or tray(now it minimizes to tray only, banishes from taskbar).
- It could use some kind of a wizard on first startup
- Event to "light up" currently moused over area (activity boxes/sources) as a preference
- Store playlists, etc in the database, rather than external files.

IDEAS:

- Accomplish the todo's first ;)
